# About me
My personal repository 

Hi, and welcome to my README.md about me.
One of my favorite things to do is read, most of the Steven King Dark Tower Novels. I only need to read The Wind Though The Keyhole. I also like reading Fantasy, Sci-Fi, and fiction book. My favorite series is the First Law Trilogy by Joe Abercrome.

I also really enjoy coding and figuring out problems. My goal is to become a software engineer and figure how to get there after practicing different programming languages and getting a bacheleors in CS for Science

One of my Hobbies I like to do is work out when I get the chance. I love to better myself and feel good while doing it. I think that person health is one of my top priorities.

Other things that I like to do is play games such as Oxygen Not Included, and almost anything from From Software.
